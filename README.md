This is the Capstone Project I have produced after completing the 25th step of Angela Yu's course : 'The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp'.

It is a simple blog where you can create posts. The elements created will not persist as no database is used in this version. The blog site is built with Node.js, Express, and EJS.
